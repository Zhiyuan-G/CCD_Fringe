# LSST_CCD_Fringe

Project start date: 5/1/2020

In this project, we explore the Fringings observed in LSST CCD sensors start from developing a general ccd stack model with the TMM module.

A CCD layer structure model is derived to identify the layer that causes the fringing patterns shown in lab data for Teledyne-e2v sensors. Using flat field images with 10nm spacing, we fit flat field data with the model to extract the thickness variations of the layer that causes the fringing pattern in E2V sensors implemented on the focal plane of the telescope in  Vera C. Rubin Observatory for Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We then use these results to simulate expected exposures of the sky in the presence of extinction lines in the atmosphere.
